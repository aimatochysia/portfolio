          I'm a Computer Science student at BINUS University in Bandung,
          Indonesia, currently interning at IDEMIA as a Software Development
          Engineering Intern.

        <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
          At IDEMIA, I focus on writing and executing test cases, particularly
          involving FIDO2 authentication protocols and APDU command sets. My
          interests span across Deep Learning, Software Engineering, Automation
          Testing, Data Science, and Full-Stack Development. I'm passionate
          about building secure, scalable, and efficient systems that bridge the
          gap between theory and real-world application.
